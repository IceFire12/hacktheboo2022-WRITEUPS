# Pumpkin Stand - WRITEUP

We are provided with challenge files. We can find out with "file" command that pumpkin_stand is an executable. We run it and we are greeted with a pumpkin and a question to choose beetwen a shovel and a laser. We start trying to test different combinations to see what kind of responses we get. After some lucky guessing we find out that combination "2" and "77", "777" or "777" returns us a fake flag that was stored in flag.txt file.

Now we just need to do this on a live docker that was provided to us to get the flag.
