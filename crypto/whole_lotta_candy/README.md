## Description

> In a parallel universe, "trick-or-treat" is played by different rules.

Instead of candy, kids have the choice of selecting a AES mode and encrypting their plaintext. If they somehow manage to find the FLAG, they get candy. Can you solve this basic problem for the toddlers of this universe?
