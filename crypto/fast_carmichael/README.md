## Description

> You are walking with your friends in search of sweets and discover a mansion in the distance. All your friends are too scared to approach the building, so you go on alone. As you walk down the street, you see expensive cars and math papers all over the yard. Finally, you reach the door. The doorbell says "Michael Fastcar". You recognize the name immediately because it was on the news the day before. Apparently, Fastcar is a famous math professor who wants to get everything done as quickly as possible. He has even developed his own method to quickly check if a number is a prime. The only way to get candy from him is to pass his challenge.
