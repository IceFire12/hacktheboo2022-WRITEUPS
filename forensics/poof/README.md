## Description

> In my company, we are developing a new python game for Halloween. I'm the leader of this project; thus, I want it to be unique. So I researched the most cutting-edge python libraries for game development until I stumbled upon a private game-dev discord server. One member suggested I try a new python library that provides enhanced game development capabilities. I was excited about it until I tried it. Quite simply, all my files are encrypted now. Thankfully I manage to capture the memory and the network traffic of my Linux server during the incident. Can you analyze it and help me recover my files? To get the flag, connect to the docker service and answer the questions.
**WARNING!** Do not try to run the malware on your host. It may harm your computer!
